Problem Statement
There are N stones, numbered 1,2,…,N. For each i (1≤i≤N), the height of Stone i is h_i

There is a frog who is initially on Stone 1. He will repeat the following action some number of times to reach Stone N:

If the frog is currently on Stone i, jump to Stone i+1 or Stone i+2. Here, a cost of |h_i-h_j| is incurred, where j is the stone to land on.
Find the minimum possible total cost incurred before the frog reaches Stone N.
